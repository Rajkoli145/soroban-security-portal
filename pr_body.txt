## Description
This PR implements the "Protocols" section as requested. The new section provides a centralized hub for all audited protocols, displaying real-time security health metrics and integrated audit data.

## Key Changes
- **Protocols Page**: A premium, responsive grid layout for protocol discovery.
- **Search & Filter**: Advanced client-side search that filters by Name, Company, Auditor, and Description.
- **Security Metrics**: Dynamic calculation of total reports, vulnerabilities, fixed issues, and Fix Rate percentage.
- **Backend Fix**: Resolved a critical Dependency Injection (DI) issue in `Startup.cs` where Singleton services were attempting to consume Scoped processors. This was essential for running the backend locally.
- **Codebase Integration**: Registered the new feature in `MainWindow.tsx` with proper navigation and routing.

## Demonstration Strategy
To effectively demonstrate the feature's metrics and search capabilities in the demo video, I implemented a temporary `SeedController` to populate the local database with sample protocols, reports, and vulnerabilities. This data allowed us to verify:
1. Correct aggregation of security stats (Fix Rate %, Report counts).
2. Multi-field search logic (filtering by Name, Auditor, and Company).
The seeding logic and demo data have been removed from this PR to maintain codebase integrity.

## Verification
- Verified local environment connectivity (Port 7878).
- Tested search responsiveness and accuracy.
- Confirmed responsive UI across grid layouts.
